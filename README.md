# AI-Powered Excel Mock Interviewer

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

The **AI-Powered Excel Mock Interviewer** is an automated system designed to assess candidates' Microsoft Excel skills efficiently and consistently. As our company rapidly expands its Finance, Operations, and Data Analytics teams, we need a scalable and intelligent solution to evaluate technical proficiency without relying on time-consuming and inconsistent manual interviews.

This project simulates a real-world interview experience by dynamically generating Excel-related questions, evaluating responses, providing feedback, and adjusting difficulty based on performance. At the end of each session, candidates receive a comprehensive report summarizing their strengths and areas for improvement.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

- Manual Excel interviews are resource-intensive and inconsistent.
- A scalable, automated solution is needed to screen candidates faster.
- The system must provide a structured interview experience with intelligent evaluation.
- It must handle sessions dynamically, provide feedback, and generate performance reports.

## ðŸ“Š Example Prompts

### Question Generation Prompt:
```
You are a knowledgeable Excel interviewer specialized in Data Analysis. The candidate has answered 3 interview questions with 2 correct and 1 wrong answers so far. Ask the next question at difficulty level 5 (0=easy, 10=hard). Provide a clear, practical Excel interview question and an ideal answer as reference.
```

### Evaluation Prompt:
```
You are an expert Excel interviewer evaluator. Given the interview question: "How do you sum values in column B where column A equals 'X'?" and the candidate's answer, evaluate correctness and provide a numeric score between 0 and 1.
```
